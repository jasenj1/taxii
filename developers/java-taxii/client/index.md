### Introduction
The Java TAXII Sample Clients provide examples of using the java-taxii library
to construct simple command line applications that send and receive TAXII messages
to a TAXII server. The sample clients are packaged as a single .jar that contains
the java-taxii library and all the required support libraries.

### Source code
The source code for the java-taxii clients is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/TAXIIProject/java-taxii-clients).

### Usage
There are shell and batch scripts provided that execute the proper classes in the .jar. Simply run these
scripts with the appropriate arguments. The scripts set the Java classpath to point to
java-taxii-clients-all.jar, if you move the scripts or the .jar, you will need to modify the scripts
to point to the location of java-taxii-clients-all.jar.

Running the scripts with no arguments will display a help page describing the expected arguments.
